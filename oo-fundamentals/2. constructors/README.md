There are three main ways to create new objects in JavaScript:

1. create a single manually using the object literal {}
2. create a single object with the keywords 'new'
3. use a constructor to create object instances of the constructor

Essentially, a constructor is used to create new objects it acts as a blueprint to what we want our object to look like.
