In this section, we will present another Computer Science data structure: Priority Queues.

## Read

A priority queue is a useful data structure that deals with the problem that "some stuff should come before other stuff".

Emergency rooms treat incoming patients with a priority queue where they triage the severity of the patient's emergency. Someone having a heart attack will probably be treated much quicker than someone with a bad paper cut.
