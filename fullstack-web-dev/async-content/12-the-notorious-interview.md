# Lesson Twelve: The Notorious Interview

There is a category of interview questions that are fairly different from all other questions. These questions are characterized by their impossible nature– they are very arbitrary and there is no way for interviewees to know the answer to them. In this lesson, we’ll give a few examples of these types of questions and cover how to handle them.

## Read
Either Microsoft or Google (depending on who you're asking) started a trend of asking candidates interview questions about the world we live in that in all likelihood, they will have no idea of the answer to. There are many variants of the most popular question:

> Why are manhole covers round?

As a programmer, how are you supposed to know this?

The fact is, nobody really does know the right answer, but that means it could be anything. Basically, the goal is for candidates to walk the Interviewer through potential answers and explain their thought process along the way.

There are many reasons it might make sense to have round manhole covers. If you’re asked this question on an interview, pick a reason and back it up. The objective is not to let these questions faze you.

- Because manholes are round! This is a bit of a cop-out, though, and you'll probably get a follow-up question like, “why are manholes round?”
- Because it makes it impossible for the cover to fall through, since the diameter of the circle will never be able to pass through something smaller.
- Because circular plates require less material to produce, given that they require the least surface area to create minimum distance from the center. It’s the most efficient use of resources.


You can see a few other viable reasons why manhole covers might be round on the Wikipedia page on manhole covers.

Generally, the interviewer is trying to extrapolate how you approach problems by surveying the way you justify your answer. For instance, take the last answer:

> It's the most efficient use of resources.

The interviewer might infer that you're conscience of the way you use computing resources like memory and threads when you’re writing software.

## Watch

No video for this module.

## Solve

 
> Write down on a piece of paper why you think manhole covers are round. Then research other "notorious" interview questions. Find three, and write down some thoughts about how you would answer these in a real interview.
