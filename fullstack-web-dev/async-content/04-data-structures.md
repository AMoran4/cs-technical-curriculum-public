# Lesson Four: Data Structures

In addition to the data structures we’ve already encountered, computer scientists have designed a few other interesting data types, which occasionally come in useful. We’ll cover these, less commonly used data structures here.

## Read

A solid foundation of different data structures of programming is pretty important in the technical interview process. A data structure is slang for a way to organize a bunch of different items together, and different data structures have different properties.

The first data structure you probably learned about was an Array, but there are a bunch of them. Each has different properties, and different scenarios where they are useful.

We've already covered a handful of data structures in the algorithm and data structure foundation course. We're going to assume you're familiar with the following data structures already.

-   Stacks
-   Queues
-   Trees

There are a few more we'll dig a bit deeper into. We'll cover advanced properties of Arrays, Hashes and talk about a new data type called a Priority Queue.

Knowing about this is important for two reasons.

- Many problems will become easier if you know how to leverage the unique properties of the data types.
- It's not uncommon for people conducting the Interview to give you a hint like, why don't you just throw all the items into a stack and them pop them back out. In his mind he has basically told you the answer, but if you don't speak the language it will sound like gibberish.

So now that we've hopefully convinced you why they matter, he's what you need to know!

## Solve

 
> Write a function that takes in a Roman numeral as an argument and returns the value as a numeric integer. 
>
> Roman numerals are written by using letters in place of integers.
> Symbol    Value
> I          1
> V          5
> X          10
> L          50
> C          100
> D          500
> M          1,000
>
> For example:
> "MCMXC" = 1990
> "MDCLXVI" = 1666
> 
> function decodeRomanNumeral(roman) {
> 
>    // YOUR CODE HERE
> 
> }
>
> TEST CASES
> console.log(decodeRomanNumeral("MCMXC")); // 1990
> console.log(decodeRomanNumeral("MDCLXVI")); // 1666
