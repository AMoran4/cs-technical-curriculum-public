# Lesson Eleven: P vs. NP vs. NP Complete

In this lesson, we'll cover the difference between algorithms that have runtimes of P, NP, and NP Complete. This is an advanced topic that computer scientists spend a lot of time thinking about.

## Read
You don't need to be an expert, but you should be aware that these concepts exist and understand why they matter.

Computer science PhDs have studied a certain category of computing problems, like the traveling salesman problem, that are known as “NP Complete” problems.

NP Complete is a narrow band of computer science problems for which no efficient solution is known. The abbreviation NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time.

Another example of an NP Complete problem is known as the knapsack problem. If you look into that problem, you’ll see that it feels pretty similar to the traveling salesman problem.

The big question computer science PhDs want to solve is:

> Does P=NP?
> 
This topic was referenced in this XKCD comic, and has even been referenced in Futurama.

What this basically means is that the answer to, “Can these problems be solved in a polynomial amount of time?” is “probably not.” However, computer scientists haven’t been able to prove a definite answer either way.

For most jobs, you won’t need to be a master with theoretical stuff like this, but the gist you want to take away is that there are some problems that are “harder” than other problems, and most people don’t work on these “hard” problems.

If you’re on an interview and asked to write a sorting algorithm, and the interviewer says it’s a “trivial” problem, what they mean is that the problem has well known solutions that are completable in polynomial time– not that it’s easy to write the algorithm from scratch.
