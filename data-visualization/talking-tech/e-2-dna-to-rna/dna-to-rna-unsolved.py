# DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the primary information storage molecule. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases:
# Guanine ('G')
# Cytosine ('C')
# Adenine ('A')
# Thymine ('T').

# RNA (Ribonucleic acid), is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA is slightly different from DNA  because its chemical structure and contains no Thymine ('T'). 

# In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

# Create a function called `DNA_to_RNA` which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

# For example:

# `DNA_to_RNA("GCAT") returns ("GCAU")`

# OPTION 1
