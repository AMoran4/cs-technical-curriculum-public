# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers, and then returns a new array with each number doubled.

# For example:
# [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]


def map_quest(arr): 

    # check if the array has items in  it

    # if  so,then loop through the entire length of the array  

    # for each iterator/index, double i
  
    # return the array
