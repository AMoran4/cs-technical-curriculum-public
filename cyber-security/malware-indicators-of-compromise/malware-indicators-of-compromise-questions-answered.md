## 1. D
As both servers crashed at exactly the same time, this is most likely a logic bomb. A logic bomb is a piece of code that sits dormant for a period of time until some event or date invokes its malicious payload - in this case, 30 days after the disgruntled employee was fired. 

## 2. C
This is most likely a firmware rootkit, possibly in the video card or expansion card. In the given scenario, the rootkit has reside outside of the operating system and applications loaded on that system. 

## 3. B 
The animated screensaver is most likely a Trojan. The software appears to do one thing, but contains hidden, additional functionality. Your colleague brought the Trojan "inside the walls" When he downloaded and installed the software on his desktop. 

## 4. C
This is quite clearly ransomware. The malware has encrypted files on the affected systems and is demanding payment for recovery of the files. 

## 5. C
This prompt most likely belongs to a backdoor - an alternate way of accessing the system. The TCP service is listening for incoming connections and prompts for a password when connections are established. Providing the correct password would grant command-line access to the system. 

## 6. A
This is classic adware behavior. Unwanted pop-ups that appear during browsing sessions regardless of the website being viewed are very typical of adware. 

## 7. D
This is most likely an infection with polymorphic malware. Polymorphic malware is designed to change its own code on a regular basis, but retain the same functionality. The changes in code are designed to mask the malware from signature-based detection. The "clean" PCs in this example are still infected, but with a variant of the malware that no longer matches any signature in the antivirus solution. 

## 8. A 
An armored virus is a piece of malware specifically designed to resist reverse engineering attempts. Zeus uses encryption in its attempts to prevent security researchers from learning how it works, how it communicates, and so on. 

## 9. B 
If specific file types are no longer usable and seem to be nothing but strings of random characters, it's likely your colleague was a victim of crypto-malware. Crypto-malware ecrypts files on a system to make them unusable to anyone without the decryption key. 

## 10. B
This is most likely a keylogger, a piece of software that records all keystrokes entered by the user. If the ex was able to access the logs generated by the keylogger, he would be able to see the new passwords for e-mail and social media accounts as they were being changed.
